# Claude Code Documentation & Decisions

## Project: Interactive RFC Learning Tutorial

## Implementation Guidelines

- When implementing each RFCs, work with individual PRs, tag the right issue in the PR, test the frontend,
  and when using any code snippets, prefer python. For each PR make a separate branch and work off that branch.
  Update the gameplan and claude.md before and after implementing changes and before submitting PRs and after
  merging them. IMPORTANT
- For each RFC, you must link to the RFC PDF so that people can choose to read the entire thing.
