# Claude Code Documentation & Decisions

## Project: Interactive RFC Learning Tutorial

## Implementation Guidelines

- When implementing each RFCs, work with individual PRs, tag the right issue in the PR, test the frontend,
  and when using any code snippets, prefer python. For each PR make a separate branch and work off that branch.
  Update the gameplan and claude.md before and after implementing changes and before submitting PRs and after
  merging them. IMPORTANT
- For each RFC, you must link to the RFC PDF so that people can choose to read the entire thing.
- Always include python examples for each RFC tutorial to demonstrate implementation and learning
- You must add docker-based examples for each RFC where relevant to show how it works locally.
- You must link to the RFC in every tutorial so people can read the original
- You must put docker code blocks in a collapsible block that has the code lines in a copyable code component.
- You must put python code blocks in an ELI-Pythonista block. Do not put generic explanations into such a block, put them separately.
- **NEW GUIDELINE**: You must not put typescript examples in the code blocks for this project. All examples must be in python. If you need typing for coherence, use pydantic. Indicate the dependencies then.

### RFC Influence and Historical Context

- Each RFC must include a dedicated section explaining its influence on the broader Internet ecosystem
- Highlight how specific RFCs fundamentally transformed network communication, protocols, and technological infrastructure
- Provide historical context on how each RFC contributed to the evolution of internet standards and technologies

### Glossary System Enhancement (July 24, 2025)

**Branch**: `fix/cross-link-routing-urls` (PR #47)
**Status**: Complete with comprehensive educational infrastructure upgrade

**Major Educational Infrastructure Improvements:**

1. **Glossary Database Expansion**:
   - Added 12 high-priority networking infrastructure terms: router, gateway, firewall, proxy, cache, load-balancer, CDN, latency, throughput, WebSocket, CORS, JWT
   - Enhanced definitions with proper categorization and related term cross-references
   - Total glossary now contains 1,662+ comprehensive networking definitions
   - Improved coverage of fundamental infrastructure, security, and web technology concepts

2. **Complete Cross-Linking Implementation**:
   - Enhanced 8 RFC tutorial files with 15+ new clickable GlossaryTerm references
   - Implemented "every instance" linking policy - all occurrences of key terms now provide educational popups
   - Fixed 12 broken cross-links using incorrect `/rfcs/` URL pattern to proper `/rfc/` routing
   - Added GlossaryTerm imports and wrappers across: RFC675, RFC2547, RFC5389, RFC793, RFC8445, RFC959, RFC8656

3. **New Dedicated Glossary Page (`/glossary`)**:
   - Full-featured browsing interface with real-time search and category filtering
   - Visual organization with color-coded category badges (Protocol, Network, Security, Web, Email, General)
   - Statistics dashboard showing term counts per category with emoji icons
   - Responsive grid layout optimized for mobile learning experience
   - Added navigation link in main header for easy access
   - 1,662+ searchable definitions with related terms cross-referencing

**Educational Impact:**

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added `/glossary` route to main App router configuration
- Enhanced Layout component with glossary navigation link
- Implemented comprehensive search and filtering functionality with React hooks
- Maintained build compatibility and performance standards

### Technical Architecture Decisions

- **Build Validation**: Always run `npm run build` before pushing to remote to ensure production compatibility
- **Testing Requirements**: Run `npm run test` to validate Playwright test coverage before submissions
- **Linting Standards**: Maintain zero ESLint warnings policy with `npm run lint`
- **Type Safety**: Ensure TypeScript compilation passes with `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **Glossary Linking**: Add every networking/security abbreviation to the glossary and link with GlossaryTerm component
- **Educational Patterns**: All complex RFCs must include ELI-Pythonista sections with Python examples and analogies
- **Code Consistency**: ALL code examples must be in Python, never TypeScript or other languages  
- **ELI-Pythonista Quality**: ELI-Pythonista sections must contain genuinely pythonic explanations and code, not generic content retrofitted with Python syntax
- **Docker Integration**: Provide hands-on Docker demonstrations for protocols where applicable
- **GitHub Actions**: Use `gh act` for local workflow testing before pushing changes

### Current Development Workflow

1. **Branch Creation**: Create feature branches following pattern `feat/batch-name` or `fix/issue-description`
2. **Implementation**: Follow established patterns with Docker examples, Python code, and educational content
3. **Local Testing**: Validate with linting, type checking, building, and Playwright tests
4. **GitHub Actions**: Test workflows locally with `gh act` before pushing
5. **Pull Request**: Create detailed PRs linking to GitHub issues with comprehensive test plans
6. **Documentation**: Update both GAMEPLAN.md and CLAUDE.md to reflect implementation progress
