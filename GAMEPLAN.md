# Interactive RFC Learning Tutorial - Game Plan

## Project Overview

An interactive, mobile-friendly web application for learning important RFCs that shaped the evolution of the internet. The application provides a chronological journey through internet history, from the first RFC in 1969 to modern HTTP standards, with rich educational content and responsive design.

## Vision

Create an engaging, educational platform that makes complex networking concepts accessible through interactive content, visual learning aids, and progressive disclosure. The goal is to bridge the gap between academic RFC documents and practical understanding of how the internet works.

## Code Examples Architecture (July 2025)

**Code Snippet Extraction Initiative**: All Python code examples have been extracted from inline JSX into separate TypeScript files for better maintainability, readability, and copy-paste functionality. This eliminates HTML entity issues (`&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lbrace;`, `&rbrace;`) and ensures clean, executable code examples.

### Extracted Code Examples

- **RFC5389**: STUN protocol (4 code files) ✅
- **RFC8445**: ICE protocol (4 code files) ✅
- **RFC1**: Host Software (2 code files) ✅
- **RFC675**: Network layers (2 code files) ✅
- **RFC791**: IPv4 addressing (4 code files) ✅
- **RFC793**: TCP implementation (3 code files) ✅
- **RFC821**: SMTP protocol (2 code files) ✅
- **Additional RFCs**: Remaining files for other protocols

### Code Block Formatting Fixes (July 23, 2025)

**Fixed Code Rendering Issues**: Replaced markdown-style code blocks (```python) with proper CodeBlock component usage in RFC5389 and RFC8445 to resolve HTML entity display issues and ensure proper syntax highlighting.

- **RFC5389**: Fixed 4 code block rendering issues ✅
- **RFC8445**: Fixed 4 code block rendering issues ✅
- **Issue Resolution**: Code now renders properly in formatted blocks instead of inline escaped text

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Infrastructure (July 24, 2025)

**GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements**: Fixed and optimized the CI/CD pipeline with separate concerns for PR validation and manual testing.

#### Issues Resolved:
- **TypeScript Type Checking**: Fixed workflow command from `npm run type-check` to `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **ESLint Configuration**: Resolved MermaidDiagram component typing issues causing linting failures
- **Playwright Test Coverage**: Updated tests to reflect current RFC count (22+ RFCs) and added coverage for Batch 6 RFCs
- **Test Infrastructure**: Added comprehensive validation for newly implemented security/NAT traversal RFCs

#### PR Build Workflow (Simplified):
- ✅ **Linting**: ESLint validation with zero warnings policy
- ✅ **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation verification  
- ✅ **Build Validation**: Complete Vite production build testing

#### Manual Docker Test Workflow:
- ✅ **Docker Validation**: Docker Compose configuration testing for all RFC examples

### GitHub Pages Direct URL Routing Fix (July 24, 2025)

**Issue Resolved**: Fixed direct URL sharing problem where individual RFC pages (like `/rfc/793`) returned 404 errors when accessed directly on GitHub Pages hosting, while navigation from the home page worked correctly.

#### Root Cause:
GitHub Pages hosts static files and doesn't handle client-side routing for Single Page Applications (SPAs). Direct URLs like `/rfc/793` don't correspond to actual files in the deployment.

#### Solution Implemented:
- **404.html Fallback**: Created fallback page that intercepts 404 errors and redirects to home page with restore parameter
- **URL Restoration Script**: Added JavaScript to index.html that detects redirects and restores original URLs using `history.replaceState()`
- **.nojekyll File**: Added to prevent Jekyll processing and ensure proper Vite asset handling
- **Seamless Experience**: Users see no visible redirect delay, URLs remain clean

#### Technical Details:
1. **Direct URL Flow**: `/rfc/793` → GitHub Pages 404 → `404.html` → redirect to `/?redirected=1` → restore `/rfc/793`
2. **Files Added**: 
   - `frontend/public/404.html` - GitHub Pages SPA redirect handler
   - `frontend/public/.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing
   - Modified `frontend/index.html` - URL restoration logic

#### Pull Request: [#45](https://github.com/stonecharioteer/interactive-rfc-tutorials/pull/45)

**Result**: Users can now share direct RFC page URLs (e.g., `https://site.github.io/rfc/793`) and they work perfectly on GitHub Pages deployment.

### Colorblind-Friendly UI Accessibility Implementation (July 25, 2025)

**Accessibility Enhancement**: Implemented scientifically-tested colorblind-friendly color palette across all UI elements to ensure full accessibility for users with deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia.

#### Problem Identified:
- Previous color scheme used too many similar red-family colors creating visual confusion
- Poor contrast between light tag backgrounds and white text made content barely readable
- Color system wasn't accessible to users with various forms of colorblindness

#### Solution Implemented:
**Colorblind-Friendly Palette** with excellent contrast:
- **Blue**: `#0072b2` (RGB: 0,114,178) - transport, cryptography, consumer tags
- **Green**: `#009e73` (RGB: 0,158,115) - application, nat-traversal, foundational tags  
- **Pink/Magenta**: `#cc79a7` (RGB: 204,121,167) - network, vpn, infrastructure tags
- **Yellow**: `#f0e442` (RGB: 240,228,66) - naming, performance, intermediate tags
- **Orange**: `#d55e00` (RGB: 213,94,0) - security, p2p, emerging tags
- **Gray**: Standard Tailwind `bg-gray-600` - legacy, advanced, enterprise tags

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Tag Components Updated**: Modified `TagBadge.tsx` and `TagFilter.tsx` to use new palette
- **Smart Text Contrast**: Implemented logic to use dark text (`text-gray-900`) on yellow backgrounds, white text on all others
- **RFC Data Updated**: All `rfcEras` and `rfcTags` color definitions updated to use new palette
- **Documentation**: Color system recorded in `CLAUDE.md` with implementation guidelines

#### Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/data/rfcs.ts` - Color palette definitions
- `frontend/src/components/TagBadge.tsx` - Badge component text contrast
- `frontend/src/components/TagFilter.tsx` - Filter component text contrast  
- `CLAUDE.md` - Color system documentation

**Result**: All tags and UI elements now provide excellent accessibility for colorblind users while maintaining visual appeal and professional appearance.

- **Ensured workflow compatibility** with GitHub Actions environment

### Benefits
